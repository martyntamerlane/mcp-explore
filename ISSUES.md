### ISSUE-1: Cannot connect to mcpplaygroundonline.com servers — no CORS headers (external, not a bug)

- **Discovered**: 2026-08-25 — user report with screenshot (`docs/external-sources/CORS_cannot_connect_2026-08-25_065957.png`) after trying `https://mcpplaygroundonline.com/mcp-complex-server`.
- **Status**: Closed — working as designed (external server limitation).
- **Severity**: N/A (external).
- **Description**: Both transports fail with "Failed to fetch" and the app shows the CORS diagnostic panel.
- **Root cause**: The server is a functioning MCP endpoint (a curl `initialize` succeeds) but sends no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header on either the preflight or the POST response, so the browser blocks every cross-origin read before the app sees any data. The site's own playground client works because it connects same-origin. Verified the same day that the app connects fine to a CORS-enabled public server (`https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp`, streamable-http, graph rendered, no console errors) — the client stack is not at fault.
- **Fix**: None possible client-side; no browser-based client can reach a server that omits CORS headers. The server owner would need to send the headers the diagnostic panel lists. A first-party opt-in CORS proxy is [TODO-7](TODO.md) — deferred because it requires SSRF hardening, infrastructure cost, a token-custody story, and reopens the zero-backend decision.
